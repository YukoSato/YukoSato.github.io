My central argument is that protests serve as focal events that may reshape voters’ political perceptions. I seek to expand the social identity theory to mass polarization by theorizing and testing how political protests may enhance individual partisan identities. Political protests provide the public with open information containing a specific political message about targeted candidates or parties. Accordingly, exposure to protests may activate pre-existing sympathy or antipathy toward the targeted group at the individual level and ultimately trigger affective polarization. To test this argument, I utilize a range of quantitative analyses, including time-series and cross-national studies and survey analysis with a natural experiment. I also triangulate quantitative methods with qualitative data gathered during my fieldwork in Brazil. The findings have implications for understanding the impact of protests on the polarization process and destabilization of democracy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Targeted Protest and Affective Polarization (Under Review)</title><link>https://yukosato.github.io/project/affective_polarization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:05:08 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://yukosato.github.io/project/affective_polarization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Political protests increasingly play a critical role in shaping politics in democracies. What political consequences did the growing global protest cycle bring about within democratic countries with unrest? Drawing on social identity theory, I argue that protest events, which targeted specific parties or leaders, would serve as a focal event that enhances voters’ attachment to partisan identity. Targeted protests provide open information containing a specific political message about targeted candidates or parties to the public. Accordingly, exposure to protests may activate and reinforce pre-existing partisan identities and ultimately trigger affective polarization at the mass level. To examine this argument, I use cross-national survey data to test whether protests targeting ruling parties increased the level of mass polarization among 38 democracies between 1996 and 2021. The findings have implications for understanding the impact of protests on voting behavior and the process of polarization in democracies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protest and State Policy Agendas: Marches and Gun Policy After Parkland</title><link>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/policy-studies_journal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 23:55:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/policy-studies_journal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Resistance to Populism</title><link>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/democratization2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 23:55:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/democratization2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Elite Coordination and Popular Protest: The Joint Effect on Democratic Change</title><link>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/democratization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 23:55:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://yukosato.github.io/publication/democratization/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
