      <title>Delegating away Democracy?: Martial Law Support in South Korea (Under Review)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do citizens sometimes accept undemocratic actions by political leaders? Building on growing debates about citizens&amp;rsquo; democratic attitudes, we argue that support for executive power grabs depends not only on citizens&amp;rsquo; partisan alignment but also on their perceptions of government performance and animosity toward political opponents. South Korea’s sudden declaration of martial law in December 2024 offers a unique real-world case to test this argument. Using original survey data collected one month after the incident from 1,500 respondents, we find that individuals with positive views of the economy, particularly incumbent supporters, are more likely to endorse martial law. Hostility toward the opposition further amplifies this support and weakens the link between economic evaluations and democratic accountability. Our findings suggest that even in established democracies, public support for democratic norms can erode rapidly in times of crisis&amp;mdash;especially under deep polarization and when citizens view the executive as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Targeted Protest and Affective Polarization (Under Review)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Political protests increasingly play a critical role in shaping politics in democracies. What political consequences did the growing global protest cycle bring about within democratic countries with unrest? Drawing on social identity theory, I argue that protest events, which targeted specific parties or leaders, would serve as a focal event that enhances voters’ attachment to partisan identity. Targeted protests provide open information containing a specific political message about targeted candidates or parties to the public. Accordingly, exposure to protests may activate and reinforce pre-existing partisan identities and ultimately trigger affective polarization at the mass level. To examine this argument, I use cross-national survey data to test whether protests targeting ruling parties increased the level of mass polarization among 38 democracies between 1996 and 2021. The findings have implications for understanding the impact of protests on voting behavior and the process of polarization in democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Autocratization Unfolds: Analyzing Institutional Order in Autocratization Episodes (R&amp;R)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are there patterns in the sequences of institutional change when democracies autocratize? Despite the growing literature on autocratization, studies have not yet systematically explored and described the order in which different aspects of democracy regress. The Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset, which identifies a global sample of 63 autocratization episodes from 1900-2022, provides the opportunity to evaluate autocratization in a quantitative framework. Using this data and pairwise domination analysis, we describe the general order of decline in 31 variables composing different accountability mechanisms constraining the government. The results yield three main findings. First, we find that institutional decay generally starts with horizontal accountability, followed by declines in diagonal accountability and, finally, vertical accountability. Second, the overall sequence of autocratization is remarkably similar in cases where democracy eventually broke down and where it ultimately survived. Finally, we find notable temporal variation: in the third wave of autocratization, declines in diagonal accountability tend to occur later than in earlier periods. By offering a systematic account of how autocratization typically unfolds, this study adds crucial insight to the growing literature on autocratization and democratic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
