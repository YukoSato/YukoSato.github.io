## Biography 

Welcome to my website!

I am an upcoming assistant professor in [the Department of International Relations at Koç University](https://gsssh.ku.edu.tr/en/departments/political-science-and-international-relations/) in Istanbul, Türkiye. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [the Democracy Institute, Central European University](https://democracyinstitute.ceu.edu/) and a research associate at [the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute at the University of Gothenburg](https://www.v-dem.net) (Sweden) and  [Waseda Institute for Advanced Study (WIAS) at Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/wias/en/) (Japan). 

I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Missouri in 2021. Before taking up my position in Budapest, I was an assistant professor at  [WIAS](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/wias/en/), a postdoctoral fellow at [the V-Dem Institute](https://www.v-dem.net), and a predoctoral fellow at [the Center for Inter-American Policy and Research (CIPR) at Tulane University](http://cipr.tulane.edu/).

My research focuses on political behavior—particularly popular protests and public opinion—and regime transformation, including both democratization and autocratization, with a regional emphasis on Latin America. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and edited volumes, including <i>Policy Studies Journal</i>, <i>Electoral Studies</i>, <i>Political Research Quarterly </i>, <i> Democratization</i>, and with Oxford University Press.
